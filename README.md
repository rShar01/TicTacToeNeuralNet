# Tic Tac Toe Neural Net

A machine learning algorithm created to play Tic Tac Toe.

Purpose:
 - I wanted to learn more about reinforcement learning, specifically Q-learning
 - I adapted a similar algorithm to Deep Mind's AlphaGo [https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270.epdf?author_access_token=VJXbVjaSHxFoctQQ4p2k4tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PVW4gB86EEpGqTRDtpIz-2rmo8-KG06gqVobU5NSCFeHILHcVFUeMsbvwS-lxjqQGg98faovwjxeTUgZAUMnRQ] To a much much lesser extent
 - I Used a value network to determine how good a given position is, and preformed a Monte Carlo Tree search down it.
