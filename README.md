# Tic Tac Toe Neural Net

A machine learning algorithm created to play Tic Tac Toe.

Purpose:
 - I wanted to learn more about reinforcement learning, specifically Q-learning
 - I adapted a similar idea to Deep Mind's AlphaGo, which uses value networks and Monte Carlo Tree searches [https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270.epdf?author_access_token=VJXbVjaSHxFoctQQ4p2k4tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PVW4gB86EEpGqTRDtpIz-2rmo8-KG06gqVobU5NSCFeHILHcVFUeMsbvwS-lxjqQGg98faovwjxeTUgZAUMnRQ]
   - I created a rudamentary matrix class to do some linear algebra for my small use cases.
 - Learn more about C++ and backpropigation
